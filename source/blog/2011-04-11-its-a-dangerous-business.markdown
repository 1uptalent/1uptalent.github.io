We have been working for more than a month now without any online presence.

That is a great sign, since without any advertising we have been able to land a really interesting project. One of those that can **truly** change the world. Its name is <a title="Tu opinas y el mundo mejora" href="http://valioo.com" target="_blank">Valioo</a> and it is still in private beta, but you can learn more and reserve your position in the queue.

Anyway, I digress.

The only purpose of this post is to announce (to no one, really) that we have started this wonderful adventure called <span class='oneuptalent'><span class='one'>1</span><span class='up'>up</span><span class='talent'>talent</span></span>. This is what we&#8217;d call our MVP (or Minimum Viable Product) for a corporate website. There&#8217;s still a lot of work to do, but let&#8217;s walk one step at a time.

> It&#8217;s a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don&#8217;t keep your feet, there&#8217;s no knowing where you might be swept off to.

We have been extremely well accompanied so far with people like the <a title="Tetuan Valley Startup School" href="http://blog.tetuanvalley.com/startupschool" target="_blank">Tetuan Valley</a><a title="Okuri Ventures" href="http://www.okuriventures.com/en/team.php" target="_blank"> crew</a> (who taught us a lot about startups) or Byron Standford (of <a title="Byron's company blog" href="http://www.project-presentation.com/blog/" target="_blank">Project Presentation</a> fame). We hope to continue walking with them in the future.

See you at the next crossroad! We&#8217;d like to walk with you until your next stopâ€¦
