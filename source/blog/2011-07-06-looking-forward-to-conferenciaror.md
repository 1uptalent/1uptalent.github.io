Next week, the amazing <a href="http://conferenciarails.org/" target="conferenciarails">Conferencia Rails</a> is taking place in Madrid. And of course we will be there **supporting** the event!

![I'm attending conferencia rails 2011](blog/2011-07-06-looking-forward-to-conferenciaror/im_attending.png)

The conference itself will be held in the historic Parque del Retiro, but the party will start the day before with a set of workshops (<a href="http://madridonrails.com/modules/?r=events/view/Talleres-de-la-Conferencia-Rails" target="workshops">at a different location</a>). And one of them is **not** about Ruby, but *<a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>*.

And there is also a session about <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script" target="coffescript">Coffeescript</a> and another titled «*Five languages in a moment*». **How cool is that?** We live in *polyglot times* and there is no reason to be stuck in a single language. Even one as nice to use as ruby.

So go check the <a href="http://conferenciarails.org/schedule.html" target="conferenciarails">schedule</a>, grab your tickets if you haven&#8217;t already and lets meet there. Or better… join us in the after-event parties!
